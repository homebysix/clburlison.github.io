      <description>Notice: This site is no created using Octopress. I have since moved to a plain Jekyll setup. Content exists mostly for reference and will not be updated in the future.
 Setting up a blog can be a time consuming task. Setting up a blog that is created from static (markdown) files can be much more time consuming. In this post, I list references to most of the custom changes that were made to this site.</description>

 This post will go over how I upload my octopress site from my computer to Amazon s3 cloud service using s3cmd.
Firstly, you will need to sign up for an Amazon AWS account if you do not have one already.</description>

      <description>This blog is setup as a personal resource for myself. Eventually, I will grow the information on this blog so that others can gain some educational value.
The site originally was hosted on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s S3 backend with the content being created through Octopress.</description>
