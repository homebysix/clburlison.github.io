      <description>For your Friday viewing pleasure I present the following cartoon.
 Credit: https://xkcd.com/356/   Background In case you do not know Apple deprecated the usage of OpenSSL in favor of Common Crypto, back with the release of OS X Lion (10.7) in 2011. On Apple&amp;rsquo;s latest operating system macOS Sierra (10.12) OpenSSL is currently at version &amp;ldquo;0.9.8zh&amp;rdquo; with very little indication that it will get updated. Now this is a specific build that Apple created and it does have a few back-ported fixes however this version doesn&amp;rsquo;t support TLSv1.</description>

      <description>With a little push from @groob, I have created a simple python script that runs a rsync command and sends a summary of the run to Slack. Slack was not created to be a storage vault for server logs however it does great for short sms style messages. If you are using a log collection service like logstash you could extend on this script to include the link to your uploaded log or if an error occurs you could automatically create a helpdesk ticket for you to investigate the issue.</description>

      <title>Import Logic Pro X Audio Content</title>

      <description>Updated for Logic 10.2.0 - September 18th, 2015
This script has been updated to support Logic Pro 10.2.0. This release included many additional audio libraries for the added Alchemy Plugin. The updated script from Hannes will now download audio content to a &amp;ldquo;__Downloaded Items&amp;rdquo; directory and create hard links to Apple&amp;rsquo;s categories.
 Today I needed to import 60 packages (37 GB) of audio content for Logic Pro X into my Munki repo.</description>
